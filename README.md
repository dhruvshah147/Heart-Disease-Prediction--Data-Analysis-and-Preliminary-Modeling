# Heart-Disease-Prediction--Data-Analysis-and-Preliminary-Modeling
This project analyzes cardiovascular disease (CVD) data to identify heart attack risk factors like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. After cleaning the data and exploring key relationships, a logistic regression model is built to predict CVD risk, serving as a baseline for further improvements.
